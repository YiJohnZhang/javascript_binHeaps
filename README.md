An implementation of a Array-Representable node-based data structures in vanilla `JavaScript` and `TypeScript` for practice.

|Date|Goal|

|2023-03-29|Started out to practice my conceptual understanding of heaps and refreshing JavaScript's `this`js.|
|2023-03-30|Considering to use this repo as practice to learn `TypeScript` and implement "algorithmically useful" array-representable nodal data structures, now including: configurable monotonic stacks.|
